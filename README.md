# Anomaly-detection-in-video-surveillance-for-public-safety

The incorporation of anomaly detection into video surveillance systems is a significant development in the field of public safety. These systems use state-of-the-art technology to automatically scan video feeds for abnormalities in behavior. This improves situational awareness and allows for proactive threat identification. Anomaly detection is essential for protecting vital infrastructure and public areas from changing security threats because it complements conventional surveillance techniques.
Beyond just preventing crimes, anomaly detection in video surveillance is important. It covers a broad spectrum of uses, such as emergency response, traffic monitoring, and crowd control. Through the proactive detection of abnormalities like unapproved entry, lingering, or atypical crowd behavior, these technologies enable authorities to proactively address possible threats and guarantee the public's safety and security.

Public safety is a fundamental concern for governments, communities, and organizations worldwide. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras in public spaces, there exists an opportunity to leverage video surveillance systems for enhancing security. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop and implement anomaly detection techniques within video surveillance systems to address the following challenges:
Identification of Suspicious Behavior.
Reduction of False Alarms.
Real-time Analysis and Response.
Privacy Preservation and Ethical Considerations.
